# Quickstart

## Installation

As with other libraries built on top of JAX, you need to install JAX with GPU if you want to get the full benefit of this library. Directions for installing JAX with GPU support can be found here: [JAX Installation Guide](https://github.com/google/jax#installation).

Using `uv` (recommended):

```bash
uv add spyx
```

## First Steps

Check out the [Tutorials](examples/surrogate_gradient/SurrogateGradientTutorial.ipynb) section! There you'll find worked examples of training SNNs completely on GPU.
