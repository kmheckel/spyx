# Welcome to Spyx!

Spyx is a compact spiking neural network library built on top of DeepMind's Haiku package.

Spyx promises the flexibility and extensibility offered by PyTorch-based SNN libraries while enabling extremely efficient training on high-performance hardware at speeds comparable to or faster than SNN frameworks that have custom CUDA implementations.

Be sure to give it a star on GitHub: [kmheckel/spyx](https://github.com/kmheckel/spyx)

## Motivation

Spyx was designed to provide a JAX-native experience for SNN researchers, making it easy to leverage JAX's powerful JIT compilation and auto-differentiation capabilities while maintaining a familiar interface for those coming from other DeepMind or Google research tools.

## For Developers

If you're contributing to Spyx or working with AI coding agents, check out [AGENTS.md](https://github.com/kmheckel/spyx/blob/main/AGENTS.md) for a comprehensive overview of the project structure, development workflow, and coding standards.
