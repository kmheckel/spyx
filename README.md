Welcome to Spyx, a library for Spiking Neural Networks in JAX!

![README Art](spyx.png "Title")

Spyx is a compact library built on top of DeepMind's Haiku library, enabling easy construction of spiking neural network models. 

The goal of Spyx is to provide similar capabilities as SNNTorch for the JAX exosystem, opening up the possibility to incorporate SNNs into a number of GPU-accelerated reinforcement learning environments.

JAX has also become home to several libraries for neuroevolution, and the aim is for Spyx to provide a common framework to compare modern neuroevolution algorithms with surrogate gradient and ANN2SNN conversion techniques.
